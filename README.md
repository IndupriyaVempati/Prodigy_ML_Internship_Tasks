# Prodigy_ML_Internship_Tasks

I would like to express my gratitude to Prodigy Infotech for providing me with the opportunity to work on these projects and for the invaluable support and guidance throughout my internship journey. Here is my approach to the tasks provided to me.

Task 1: House Price Prediction
This project builds a linear regression model to predict house prices based on area (square footage), number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The model is trained on a real estate dataset, enabling accurate predictions of house prices based on key features.

Task 2: Customer Segmentation
This project applies K-means clustering to segment retail store customers based on purchase history. Customers are grouped into clusters based on their purchase frequency and spending patterns, allowing businesses to tailor marketing strategies effectively.

Task 3: Cat vs Dog Classification
This project implements an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier to distinguish between cat and dog images. Images are preprocessed, resized, and normalized, and the model is trained to classify new images with high accuracy.

Task 4: Hand Gesture Recognition
This project focuses on hand gesture recognition for intuitive human-computer interaction. Using deep learning techniques like CNNs, the model classifies different hand gestures, enabling gesture-based control for various applications.

Task 5: Food Recognition
This project develops a food recognition model to identify food items from images and estimate their calorie content. Using deep learning (CNNs), the system helps users track their diet by providing nutritional insights for better health management.

 Thank you, Prodigy Infotech, for this enriching experience!!!
